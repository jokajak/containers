# geyser-mc

[Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) is a program that allows Minecraft: Bedrock
Edition clients to join a Minecraft: Java Edition server, allowing for true
crossplay between both editions of the game.

This container runs a standalone geyser service with the geyserconnect plugin so
that multiple servers can be connected to through a single geyser instance.

The default geyser configuration comes from
<https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/blob/9cb9a1450e6740df5abef30ff4261a0f75b8c32d/core/src/main/resources/config.yml>

The default geyse connect configuration comes from
<https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserConnect/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml>
